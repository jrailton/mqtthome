VENUS GX FORGETS ALL THESE SETTINGS AFTER AND UPDATE BECAUSE FILESYSTEM IS OVERWRITTEN BY UPDATE
SO IF YOU CARE, DISABLE AUTO UPDATING

1. Set access level to Superuser
To set the root password, first set the access level to Superuser:
Go to Settings, General
Set the Access Level to User and installer, the password is ZZZ
Highlight Access Level (don't open the select page!)
Press and hold the right button of the center pad until you see the Access Level change to Superuser. Note: when working from the Remote Console, you need to use the right key on your keyboard. Pressing and holding the right button with your mouse won't work.
Now you have access to the super user features.
2. Create a root password
Go to Settings ? General ? Set root password. And create a root password.
Note that, for firmware version v2.00 and later, the root password will be reset by a firmware update. The reason is that the passwd file is on the rootfs, which is fully replaced by an update. More info here.
Our advice is to create a root password. But use it to login only the first time, and then install a public ssh key(s). Thereafter login with the keys.

1. Login on SSH (putty) with root and whatever password you configured
2. nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.configured
3. Create MQTT bridge similar to below:
#connection to mqtthome
connection bridge-01
address <mqtthome-mosquitto-ip>:1883
topic # out 0
4. reboot and you're good to go
