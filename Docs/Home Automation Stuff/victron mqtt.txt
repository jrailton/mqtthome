Venus/CCGX MQTT broker will stop publishing to subscribed topics if no publish command received every 60 seconds. You can start it pushlishing again by posting this:
.\mosquitto_pub.exe -h 10.0.0.59 -t "R/7c386655e76b/system/0/Serial" -n
NOTICE ITS A PUB, NOT A SUB! AND THAT 7c386655e76b IS THE SERIAL NUMBER OF THE VENUS/CCGX

To bridge the Venus/CCGX broker to another broker i.e. to make it post all its topics to another broker or to make it subscribe to another broker, edit the mosquitto.conf:
nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

#connection CoreMqtt
connection bridge-01

# ip/port of remote broker
address 10.0.0.70:1883

# you can also use "both" instead of a line for "in" and another for "out", or exclude one or the other to not bridge subscribe/publish respectively
# if you want to remap topics you can specify them here. See this link for more info: http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/mosquitto-bridge-configuration/
